B09R95CGSW,23-Mar-23,RU6F758GNRXII,Harold ,5,"This XR65A80K I purchased was to replace an XR65X950H - the 950H is a very competent TV, and is still in use in a bedroom, but even as good as it is with its local dimming, the idea of zero blooming appealed to me. Fortunately, I have my oldest son's 55"" LG C2 for a direct comparison, and while the C2 is slightly brighter and a better choice for next gen gaming, I felt the A80K was a better choice for my viewing habits, as most of my use is for movies, occasional YouTube browsing and every now and then, Nintendo Switch for retro games. After over a month to wring the Sony out on everything from 480 material ranging all the way up to 4K UHD Blu-rays, I can say that, as usual, Sony has done some awesome work here.Firstly,much has been made of OLED's shortcomings in moderately lit rooms - I'll make this point early, this panel is as capable as the Bravia 65X950H it replaced.Yes, specular highlights are brighter (1100+ nits for the 950 vs ~700 nits for the A80K), but those numbers only tell part of the story.With 8 million plus self lighting organic light emitting diodes, the blacks are perfect, and the brightness of those specular highlights are far more clearly defined.Yes, if you have a room flooded with sunlight, OLED isn't going to overcome that, but in a room moderately lit by sun, like mine, it's more than capable. Nighttime viewing is exceptional.The good:*Infinite contrast due to OLED technology. The inky blacks are only part of the story here, the clear distinction of a specular highlight against a far dimmer area create a far more enjoyable movie experience.*Out of the box color accuracy is amazing.First things first, on this and nearly every TV, Power Saving needs to be turned off.Picture Mode should be set to Custom, and in HDR, Gradation Preferred should be enabled.Only change I made to color itself was to slightly reduce the bias on the green sub pixels and slightly boost overall color saturation, the latter of which is something I've done on nearly every TV I've owned.*Processing.While I generally leave any additional video noise reduction and motion processing off, the few times I've felt the need to use any of them, they've been adjustable enough to add just what I wanted without the source material losing its sharpness or inducing soap opera effect.*Upscaling.As per usual, Sony's processing is second to none, although admittedly, LG has definitely closed the gap with the C2. Still, Sony has a visible edge here.*Sound. Although I use a Dolby Atmos/DTS X soundbar with surround speakers, the sound from the TV itself was surprisingly good.Since the panel is actually a speaker, the soundstage is pretty impressive - impressive enough to likely satisfy many people.*Operating temperature.I'd normally leave this out, but I honestly cannot believe how much cooler this thing runs when compared to an LED backlit LCD panel.I foresee this being a huge bonus this summer.*Lack of ""black crushing"": This is probably the biggest difference between the A80K and the C2 as far as picture quality.Details in dark scenes are clearly visible on the Sony, whereas they sometimes get lost on the C2.The ""it could be better"":*Brightness.This is really nit picking (no pun intended), but given that the A80K uses the same panel as the C2, yet is not quite as bright as somewhat of a mystery to me. To be honest, I can't see a definitive difference between the two, but it's worth mentioning.The Bad:*Only two HDMI 2.1 inputs, one of which is the same port used for a soundbar or receiver. To be fair, unless you're into next gen (PS5/Xbox X) gaming and have both consoles, this isn't going to be an issue, but a TV of this caliber should have four 2.1 inputs.*Potential for panel burn in.OLED technology has come a long way in the last decade, but the potential is still there for permanent burn in on individual pixels.If you watch a ton of TV (CNN with their bright white/red logo is a perfect example) that has a static logo, OLED probably shouldn't be on your want list, at least not yet.*Sustained bright picture will auto dim to protect the panel.While I've yet to experience this in anything other than intentionally trying to induce it, content with relatively bright areas over the majority of the panel, like ice hockey games,will activate auto dimming.*Dolby Vision.Please Sony, fix this.DV Dark is so out of whack that it's not even funny.While DV Bright can be made to look perfect as a DV Dark alternative, we deserve better.You did it on the A95K and LG's is great on their OLEDs, so we know it's possible.Remote: I get it, this isn't their flagship OLED, but it should come with the backlit remote.Movies and TV shows are this TV's strong points, and is particularly impressive with 4K High Dynamic Range/Dolby Vision content, both with hard copy and the built-in Google TV operating system.If sports (especially hockey) and/or the majority of your content has static logos, I'd probably stick with an LED backlit LCD TV.In closing, I did also consider the Sony A95K, the Samsung S95B and the LG C2 and G2.I passed on the Sony and Samsung because QD OLED is in its infancy, with a lot of long term questions about both burn in and longevity.The G2 lost out mostly because of the extra cost of a table top stand (wall mounting is not an option in my case).The A80K won over the C2 because of slightly better upscaling, the ability to pass DTS audio and the C2 having some problems with black crush.","Impressive TV, especially for movies",TRUE,"Title: Impressive TV, especially for movies Review: This XR65A80K I purchased was to replace an XR65X950H - the 950H is a very competent TV, and is still in use in a bedroom, but even as good as it is with its local dimming, the idea of zero blooming appealed to me.

B09R95CGSW,8-Apr-23,R35VYWRYIAMWKD,Brandon Goldsmith,5,"My LED TV developed some sort of light leakage that resulted in a large spot displaying on the screen. I was like every scene featured a beautiful sunset.So, time to buy another TV! My natural inclination was to go with Samsung (I have other Samsung TVs that are going strong after years), but since this was the brand that failed—more precisely the technology used by Samsung—I started researching the technology I should be going with.After and lot a of reading and video watching I decided that OLED would be the best (really because its ability to turn off pixels and so create truly black blacks) and so looked for a good deal.It so happened that Sony was running a promotion on theBravia A80K, so that (together with a strong recommendation from my son who owns the same model but larger size) persuaded me to buy this model.Compared to my old TV, it's really night and day. I did have a 4K TV before, but this is better in so many ways. The colors are superbly rendered and the sound—which I feed into my eARC-enabled AVR—is really great. I can now get Dolby Atmos content rendered very nicely.The TV was really easy to set up but, and Sony warns you of this, you need two people to unpack and position the TV safely. The legs are easy to attach, but you need help to stabilize the TV while you do so. The menus are easy to navigate and setting up the screen and audio options was easy—I did have help from my son who, as I said, is familiar with the TV, but I could easily have done it myself.One of the things to get used to is having 2 ARC HDMI ports (there are 2 regular HDMIs too), so my Firestick is plugged into the back of the TV now, rather than the AVR. This is all possible because of eARC, so that is a big deal. Fortunately by AVR also has eARC, so connecting my system was easy: eARC from TV's HDMI 3 and Firestick into HDMI 4. I also plugged an ethernet cable into the ethernet port, which also made setting up super-easy. Having a hard-wired network connection (wifi is also available I think)made initial firmware updates really easy.I had read that there was an issue with the TV not being particularly bright. I have not found this to be the case at all, and our TV-watching room has a lot of ambient light.The remote control is very nicely designed and can you control connected devices as well as the TV. I use another kind of controller, but if I hadn't already bought that, I would certainly be using the Sony remote to control everything.In summary: Picture is superb, sound is amazing, set-up is easy. I am absolutely loving this TV and would highly recommend it to anybody wishing to step up the capabilities of their home viewing system.","Bravo, Sony!",TRUE,"Title: Bravo, Sony!

I skipped the Samsung because the tech is too new and I purchase a television every 3 years or so.This will give all of the makers who will be selling the new QD oleds ( which will be everyone) to get it right.If you can afford more for the A90k or A90J, I would definitely say to go for it.This television is worth every bit of 1700 bucks. Please check out Quantum, HDTV, Classy Tech, Rtings, or Fomo on their youtube channels to get their info and picture mode calibrations.

The picture quality is superb, and I haven't felt the need to do a lot of tweaking, much less calibration, to get it there (as I have in the past on other TV's). The overall look of the TV is very minimalistic, as the edge of the screen and the stand nearly disappear. Speaking of the stand, it's very stable while being low profile, and the multiple installation methods to modify the height, while I haven't needed them, are a useful feature that I'm sure many will appreciate. I can't speak to the internal speakers as I don't use them, but I can say the arc features work very well and very seamlessly. I can just turn on the Apple TV, and the TV and reciever both turn on and move to their correct inputs. Likewise, I can turn on the TV, and the same adjustments are made. I find I seldom need to adjust the TV or receiver. Just turn on the source and go. I've had issues with other TV's where arc either didn't do all I needed or at times, was fighting what I was trying to do. None of that with this TV.

The picture quality is definitely great. I like that it acts as a Chromecast without having to plug in an actual Chromecast device. However, there are some really annoying problems that nearly outweigh it's greatness.1. The smart TV menus are often slow/laggy. It's pretty egregious shortly after startup (~2 second response time to button presses on the remote), but beyond that there are occasional hitches constantly and I never know if it just didn't read a button press or if it's just lagging. It feels like using a really old PC laden with viruses or something. I suspect it's a combination of the processor being underpowered and the software being poorly optimized.2. It has difficulty doing 4k@120hz with my PC (NVIDIA 3090Ti). Usually it's fine, but sometimes when Windows starts up the screen just goes black with occasional flickers of signal. Unplugging+replugging the HDMI cable fixes it, but it's really annoying that I have to do this every time I turn on my PC. Also, when I shut the PC off, the TV actually crashes+restrarts. This makes me certain it's a problem with Sony's firmware rather than NVIDIA's drivers.3. After only ~4 months of moderate usage, a large swath of pixels on the left side of the screen is becoming slightly darker/discolored. It's mostly only noticeable when the screen is a solid color that is either very bright or very dark, but it's definitely noticeable, and I'm worried it will get worse over time.These issues really put a damper on what is otherwise a really nice OLED Google TV.

The Bravia is really nice to take advantage of my PS5 though, having VRR, HDR, and 4k resolution makes games look great.

I decided to go for the Sony and based on all of the reviews about how the Sony has the best processing and best picture quality It was a no brainer. I even owned a Sony A1E oled (2017 model) and that tv was great I ended up giving it to my dad a few years ago.With the Sony A80K I was expecting an upgraded version of the Sony A1E oled being this was a newer model Oled with a better processor but boy I was very disappointed I am not sure what it was but the picture seemed washed out and the ABL was very annoying it would dim even from watching regular SDR content and the picture quality was not good even after playing with the settings for a week. The Sony was not as bright either.I know it may be a myth but I personally feel like TVs that have the glossy screen show a much better picture compared to tvs with semi gloss screen this tv has a semi gloss screen. I tried very hard to force myself to enjoy this tv but there was nothing about it that made me go wow I like this tv to where I was comfortable with my $2,900 investment.Another issue is with the way the HDMI ports are angled if you plan on using all 4 hdmi ports at once the Amazon 4K firestick will not fit because for some reason Sony made the back of the tv thicker. You will have to remove maybe 2 hdmi ports in order to make room for the 4K firestick to fit.In the end I did return this tv for the C2 and I am in love with my C2 is has everything I could ever ask for in a tv and it is a night and day difference compared to the Sony.I am not bias towards any brands I enjoy all tech and have owned all TVs in the past from lg to Sony to Samsung and I have owned oled since 2016 aside from my Samsung Neo QLED tv that I purchased last year.",Disappointed !!!,TRUE,"Title: Disappointed !!!

There are a few good videos on setup on YouTube, you can even use an A80J video for setup and learning what each setting does. Once done, the videos and the high-quality streaming picture look stunning, there is depth to the picture, the color is natural, and the picture is not too bright with a glare like many, but natural brightness and some say it's not bright enough, we'll look at the world around us or a sunny day does what we see look hard and overly bright and glow, no.That is the magic of the Sony OLED, what unnatural brightness than buying TVs that give it to you, the Sony is about making the picture look correct and natural. Watching in a low-light room, the picture pops the room does not have to be dark with all lights turned off but just a few lamps on.This war on TV brightness from brands can mean little if you don't have the specular highlights in the picture, say a lamp is brighter than the rest of the picture or headlights on a car beam and glow, to the point it looks real. A bright screen has nothing to do with that, is the XR processor at work.The screen has a matted finish to defect light reflections, and this is different from the mirror finish on my other OLED TVs, so the reflection looks different, and more defused while say my C9 or the C2 I have mirror-like reflection is sharp and clear. but when the A80K is on the screen really does lower the reflections while the mirror-like screen on other OLED TVs is sharp and clear on the screen while watching, so to me it's a toss-up on which one is better.Now the LGC2 I also owned. Wonderful TV, easy to set up, and has a bright picture and very good color. But what cannot match the Sony is the small details, specular highlights, depth of image, and gradients of blacks. It's like watching a concert on the Sony, and it has the look and feel of a live concert, with depth, colors pop, details, etc. the LGC2 looks like a superb picture but you don't feel it like being there, spotlight shinning on the performers are less noticeable or pop, colors don't pop as much, detail in the clothing does not stick out as much, etc. There is something about the Sony processing that brings things to life. While the LGC2 just gives you a very bright overall picture, you don't get the different shades of brightness levels say different lamps on in a movie, LGC2 does not give you that.I read about issues in some reviews but I have not had any. I run it to my ZVOX Soundbase (580) with optical, out of the sound base, then I use sub out which I can connect my 3 subwoofers, and the sound is superb with no issues, all you have to do is go into to sound settings pick optical out, PCM and select wire speaker you are done. If you don't take the time to do this and you have sound issues it is not the Sony it is the setup, same for picture quality, it is the user, not the TV.HDMI wise used inputs 3-4 and selected enhanced setting or the same for inputs 1-2 for cable and DVD, but I use 3-4 one for my cable and one for my 4K Blu-ray player both of those inputs are 2.1.While no TV is perfect, the Sony for pure movie watching, DVD high-quality disc playback, and lastly streaming movies, which is limited to quality due to bandwidth and your router bandwidth, still looks superb on the Sony, but the DVD counterpart of the same movie IS jaw-dropping good.I am not a gamer so I have no concern about gaming, but I can tell you for everything else I take this TV over the LGC2 hands down, and I love the LGC2 and you won't go wrong buying that TV either, it is easy to set up and enjoyable to watch, it is just a different picture and I would say a more pastel look to it, laid back, warmer, but still excellent, you cannot go wrong with either, it is a preference.For me owning both the Sony wins overall. As my wife said, there is always something about the Sony picture it looks just natural. That is about right.Update: The picture continues to improve as its logs more time on, and brightness also, I was at bright at max now I can turn it down to 40 and the picture still pops. so, there is a use timeframe for this TV as well as my LGC2 which I returned to keep the Sony A80K.Settings on the Sony after use, are really easy, just choose the custom picture setting, in settings, make sure auto-dimming is turned off in that section, Gamma -1, Realty Creation auto, Smoothing set at 1, and Motion Flow on High. You are done.I can now say HDR and Dolby vision also look better than the LGC2 hands down. The Sony XR processor is unbeatable, and for the 80K, they also use XR Contrast Pro like the A90J. Even the HD video looks better than the LGC2, I watched Mr. and Mrs. Jones last night, after watching it on the LGC2 and It was like watching a different movie, the picture looked that much better.The A80K for pure picture processing and quality for the price is unmatched, while expensive its lower than the higher priced ones, gives you 90% of the best, and kills the Samsung OLED which has had nothing but issues, and picture issues, which is Samsungs ongoing quality control issues. Buy LGC2 or better yet the Sony OLEDs.If you use the TV speakers the Dolby sound settings are very, very good. I use the processing set to PCM mode and I use digital out to my ZVOX sound base from the sound base I run able to my powered sub-woofer, which from there piggybacks the output to 2 more subs.

B09R95CGSW,25-Nov-22,R38ID28GMAHUAR,Bryant L.,5,"Update Review after 2 months of ownership:So my only gripe with this TV was that everytime you press the power button on the remote to turn it on, the Google OS would pop up first making me select the Input for my Computer manually. Well today, I randomly solved this problem. Rather than pressing the power button on the remote, I noticed I accidently press the ""TV"" button. Doing so turn the TV on to the last input mode I had on!. 5/5 stars now.Past Review:I've bought many TV's over the years. I usually buy 50"" or above. With that being said I usually buy the ones that are $700. This TV is over twice that price of course, but honestly, I've never been so amazed at the picture quality of a TV before. Playing the new God of War Ragnarok on it is really something to be seen in person. I'm not going to take pictures of it because the photos wouldn't do it justice. The level of detail Sony did with the game is brought to another level on this TV compared to my 2 year old 55"" Samsung. Now my Samsung TV isn't an OLED tv so it's unfair to compare the two. However, I can say that there is certainly a major difference in picture quality between the two. If you're asking yourself if it really is worth $1600? I would say probably not. However, your paying a premium because it's Sony Brand and the reason I felt okay to purchase this as my first OLED TV is because of that so I know it's probably a good $200-$400 above some lesser known brands which may have similar picture quality. The only thing I don't like about the TV is everytime you turn it on, it loads Google TV. So each time I gotta press the input button on whether I want to play on my PS5 or my Computer. I'm completely digital and I don't have cable or satellite; but I doubt that would change the way it starts up. You'd really want to have some type of internet hooked up to use this TV however it's not completely necessary. I used it for a few days when I first bought it before I had internet installed at my apartment and it works fine. It's just that having the internet would give you the full potential of its abilities since it's operating system is Google TV. I gave this TV a 4/5 only because there's no option for 4.5/5. Once last thing to note is that whenever I turn it on or off, it makes a loud click noise. I'm assuming it's a capacitor turning on/off. I'm only concerned with the sound because I had a TV in the past that made the same level of sound when I turned it on/off and eventually the capacitor blew after 2 years of use. It was an easy fix but not something you'd want to see yourself doing after only owning something for 2 years. I'll certainly update my review if something like that happens in the future.","Amazing picture quality, especially when used with a PS5.",TRUE,"Title: Amazing picture quality, especially when used with a PS5. Review: Update Review after 2 months of ownership:So my only gripe with this TV was that everytime you press the power button on the remote to turn it on, the Google OS would pop up first making me select the Input for my Computer manually. Well today, I randomly solved this problem. Rather than pressing the power button on the remote, I noticed I accidently press the ""TV"" button. Doing so turn the TV on to the last input mode I had on!. 5/5 stars now.Past Review:I've bought many TV's over the years. I usually buy 50"" or above. With that being said I usually buy the ones that are $700. This TV is over twice that price of course, but honestly, I've never been so amazed at the picture quality of a TV before. Playing the new God of War Ragnarok on it is really something to be seen in person. I'm not going to take pictures of it because the photos wouldn't do it justice. The level of detail Sony did with the game is brought to another level on this TV compared to my 2 year old 55"" Samsung. Now my Samsung TV isn't an OLED tv so it's unfair to compare the two. However, I can say that there is certainly a major difference in picture quality between the two. If you're asking yourself if it really is worth $1600? I would say probably not. However, your paying a premium because it's Sony Brand and the reason I felt okay to purchase this as my first OLED TV is because of that so I know it's probably a good $200-$400 above some lesser known brands which may have similar picture quality. The only thing I don't like about the TV is everytime you turn it on, it loads Google TV. So each time I gotta press the input button on whether I want to play on my PS5 or my Computer. I'm completely digital and I don't have cable or satellite; but I doubt that would change the way it starts up. You'd really want to have some type of internet hooked up to use this TV however it's not completely necessary. I used it for a few days when I first bought it before I had internet installed at my apartment and it works fine. It's just that having the internet would give you the full potential of its abilities since it's operating system is Google TV. I gave this TV a 4/5 only because there's no option for 4.5/5.

I only wished to hang my TV like a big picture within a wall nook especially recessed for 55"" TVs. Using two plain old M6 x 1"" bolts do the job just fine into the back of the set, along with some steel or copper wire cabling between them. The set only weighs 35 pounds or so. Takes 2 people to hang on the wall hangars, which can be 1"" fender washers on sturdy wood lag screws for certainty it won't ever slip off. If you don't need to swing your set out and pivot it around, there's no need to spend $100-300 on a fancy ""flush-mount"" bracket that does that.

I will begin this review by saying O.M.G. what an amazing picture this Sony 2022 A80K 65"" OLED TV has. With that said i have upgraded from a Sony 2019 XBR 55"" X950G LED TV, which by the way still looks really good. Having both TV's side to side i now understand the difference in OLED compared to LED. In this day & age with all the high tech even in TV's you can't go wrong in which model you choose it's more a preference than anything else. However i am totally impressed & sold on the Sony OLED TV, this thing is amazing. Yes it's not a QLED like the Samsung S95B, or the Sony A95K but it's still a very great contender & at a much less compatible price. I am a gamer & have been using the Sony PS5, as well as the Xbox Series X & also enjoy watching movies. With that said both consoles look absolutely stunning on the OLED TV. The picture quality, the sound, the 120 Hz, the VRR. the ALLM, etc. are all phenomenal.
