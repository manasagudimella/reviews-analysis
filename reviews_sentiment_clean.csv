B09R95CGSW,23-Mar-23,RU6F758GNRXII,Harold ,5,"This XR65A80K I purchased was to replace an XR65X950H - the 950H is a very competent TV, and is still in use in a bedroom, but even as good as it is with its local dimming, the idea of zero blooming appealed to me. Fortunately, I have my oldest son's 55"" LG C2 for a direct comparison, and while the C2 is slightly brighter and a better choice for next gen gaming, I felt the A80K was a better choice for my viewing habits, as most of my use is for movies, occasional YouTube browsing and every now and then, Nintendo Switch for retro games. After over a month to wring the Sony out on everything from 480 material ranging all the way up to 4K UHD Blu-rays, I can say that, as usual, Sony has done some awesome work here.Firstly,much has been made of OLED's shortcomings in moderately lit rooms - I'll make this point early, this panel is as capable as the Bravia 65X950H it replaced.Yes, specular highlights are brighter (1100+ nits for the 950 vs ~700 nits for the A80K), but those numbers only tell part of the story.With 8 million plus self lighting organic light emitting diodes, the blacks are perfect, and the brightness of those specular highlights are far more clearly defined.Yes, if you have a room flooded with sunlight, OLED isn't going to overcome that, but in a room moderately lit by sun, like mine, it's more than capable. Nighttime viewing is exceptional.The good:*Infinite contrast due to OLED technology. The inky blacks are only part of the story here, the clear distinction of a specular highlight against a far dimmer area create a far more enjoyable movie experience.*Out of the box color accuracy is amazing.First things first, on this and nearly every TV, Power Saving needs to be turned off.Picture Mode should be set to Custom, and in HDR, Gradation Preferred should be enabled.Only change I made to color itself was to slightly reduce the bias on the green sub pixels and slightly boost overall color saturation, the latter of which is something I've done on nearly every TV I've owned.*Processing.While I generally leave any additional video noise reduction and motion processing off, the few times I've felt the need to use any of them, they've been adjustable enough to add just what I wanted without the source material losing its sharpness or inducing soap opera effect.*Upscaling.As per usual, Sony's processing is second to none, although admittedly, LG has definitely closed the gap with the C2. Still, Sony has a visible edge here.*Sound. Although I use a Dolby Atmos/DTS X soundbar with surround speakers, the sound from the TV itself was surprisingly good.Since the panel is actually a speaker, the soundstage is pretty impressive - impressive enough to likely satisfy many people.*Operating temperature.I'd normally leave this out, but I honestly cannot believe how much cooler this thing runs when compared to an LED backlit LCD panel.I foresee this being a huge bonus this summer.*Lack of ""black crushing"": This is probably the biggest difference between the A80K and the C2 as far as picture quality.Details in dark scenes are clearly visible on the Sony, whereas they sometimes get lost on the C2.The ""it could be better"":*Brightness.This is really nit picking (no pun intended), but given that the A80K uses the same panel as the C2, yet is not quite as bright as somewhat of a mystery to me. To be honest, I can't see a definitive difference between the two, but it's worth mentioning.The Bad:*Only two HDMI 2.1 inputs, one of which is the same port used for a soundbar or receiver. To be fair, unless you're into next gen (PS5/Xbox X) gaming and have both consoles, this isn't going to be an issue, but a TV of this caliber should have four 2.1 inputs.*Potential for panel burn in.OLED technology has come a long way in the last decade, but the potential is still there for permanent burn in on individual pixels.If you watch a ton of TV (CNN with their bright white/red logo is a perfect example) that has a static logo, OLED probably shouldn't be on your want list, at least not yet.*Sustained bright picture will auto dim to protect the panel.While I've yet to experience this in anything other than intentionally trying to induce it, content with relatively bright areas over the majority of the panel, like ice hockey games,will activate auto dimming.*Dolby Vision.Please Sony, fix this.DV Dark is so out of whack that it's not even funny.While DV Bright can be made to look perfect as a DV Dark alternative, we deserve better.You did it on the A95K and LG's is great on their OLEDs, so we know it's possible.Remote: I get it, this isn't their flagship OLED, but it should come with the backlit remote.Movies and TV shows are this TV's strong points, and is particularly impressive with 4K High Dynamic Range/Dolby Vision content, both with hard copy and the built-in Google TV operating system.If sports (especially hockey) and/or the majority of your content has static logos, I'd probably stick with an LED backlit LCD TV.In closing, I did also consider the Sony A95K, the Samsung S95B and the LG C2 and G2.I passed on the Sony and Samsung because QD OLED is in its infancy, with a lot of long term questions about both burn in and longevity.The G2 lost out mostly because of the extra cost of a table top stand (wall mounting is not an option in my case).The A80K won over the C2 because of slightly better upscaling, the ability to pass DTS audio and the C2 having some problems with black crush.","Impressive TV, especially for movies",TRUE,"Title: Impressive TV, especially for movies Review: This XR65A80K I purchased was to replace an XR65X950H - the 950H is a very competent TV, and is still in use in a bedroom, but even as good as it is with its local dimming, the idea of zero blooming appealed to me.

B09R95CGSW,23-Mar-23,RU6F758GNRXII,Harold ,5,"This XR65A80K I purchased was to replace an XR65X950H - the 950H is a very competent TV, and is still in use in a bedroom, but even as good as it is with its local dimming, the idea of zero blooming appealed to me. Fortunately, I have my oldest son's 55"" LG C2 for a direct comparison, and while the C2 is slightly brighter and a better choice for next gen gaming, I felt the A80K was a better choice for my viewing habits, as most of my use is for movies, occasional YouTube browsing and every now and then, Nintendo Switch for retro games. After over a month to wring the Sony out on everything from 480 material ranging all the way up to 4K UHD Blu-rays, I can say that, as usual, Sony has done some awesome work here.Firstly,much has been made of OLED's shortcomings in moderately lit rooms - I'll make this point early, this panel is as capable as the Bravia 65X950H it replaced.Yes, specular highlights are brighter (1100+ nits for the 950 vs ~700 nits for the A80K), but those numbers only tell part of the story.With 8 million plus self lighting organic light emitting diodes, the blacks are perfect, and the brightness of those specular highlights are far more clearly defined.Yes, if you have a room flooded with sunlight, OLED isn't going to overcome that, but in a room moderately lit by sun, like mine, it's more than capable. Nighttime viewing is exceptional.The good:*Infinite contrast due to OLED technology. The inky blacks are only part of the story here, the clear distinction of a specular highlight against a far dimmer area create a far more enjoyable movie experience.*Out of the box color accuracy is amazing.First things first, on this and nearly every TV, Power Saving needs to be turned off.Picture Mode should be set to Custom, and in HDR, Gradation Preferred should be enabled.Only change I made to color itself was to slightly reduce the bias on the green sub pixels and slightly boost overall color saturation, the latter of which is something I've done on nearly every TV I've owned.*Processing.While I generally leave any additional video noise reduction and motion processing off, the few times I've felt the need to use any of them, they've been adjustable enough to add just what I wanted without the source material losing its sharpness or inducing soap opera effect.*Upscaling.As per usual, Sony's processing is second to none, although admittedly, LG has definitely closed the gap with the C2.

B09R95CGSW,23-Mar-23,RU6F758GNRXII,Harold ,5,"This XR65A80K I purchased was to replace an XR65X950H - the 950H is a very competent TV, and is still in use in a bedroom, but even as good as it is with its local dimming, the idea of zero blooming appealed to me. Fortunately, I have my oldest son's 55"" LG C2 for a direct comparison, and while the C2 is slightly brighter and a better choice for next gen gaming, I felt the A80K was a better choice for my viewing habits, as most of my use is for movies, occasional YouTube browsing and every now and then, Nintendo Switch for retro games. After over a month to wring the Sony out on everything from 480 material ranging all the way up to 4K UHD Blu-rays, I can say that, as usual, Sony has done some awesome work here.Firstly,much has been made of OLED's shortcomings in moderately lit rooms - I'll make this point early, this panel is as capable as the Bravia 65X950H it replaced.Yes, specular highlights are brighter (1100+ nits for the 950 vs ~700 nits for the A80K), but those numbers only tell part of the story.With 8 million plus self lighting organic light emitting diodes, the blacks are perfect, and the brightness of those specular highlights are far more clearly defined.Yes, if you have a room flooded with sunlight, OLED isn't going to overcome that, but in a room moderately lit by sun, like mine, it's more than capable. Nighttime viewing is exceptional.The good:*Infinite contrast due to OLED technology. The inky blacks are only part of the story here, the clear distinction of a specular highlight against a far dimmer area create a far more enjoyable movie experience.*Out of the box color accuracy is amazing.First things first, on this and nearly every TV, Power Saving needs to be turned off.Picture Mode should be set to Custom, and in HDR, Gradation Preferred should be enabled.Only change I made to color itself was to slightly reduce the bias on the green sub pixels and slightly boost overall color saturation, the latter of which is something I've done on nearly every TV I've owned.*Processing.While I generally leave any additional video noise reduction and motion processing off, the few times I've felt the need to use any of them, they've been adjustable enough to add just what I wanted without the source material losing its sharpness or inducing soap opera effect.*Upscaling.As per usual, Sony's processing is second to none, although admittedly, LG has definitely closed the gap with the C2. Still, Sony has a visible edge here.*Sound. Although I use a Dolby Atmos/DTS X soundbar with surround speakers, the sound from the TV itself was surprisingly good.Since the panel is actually a speaker, the soundstage is pretty impressive - impressive enough to likely satisfy many people.*Operating temperature.I'd normally leave this out, but I honestly cannot believe how much cooler this thing runs when compared to an LED backlit LCD panel.I foresee this being a huge bonus this summer.*Lack of ""black crushing"": This is probably the biggest difference between the A80K and the C2 as far as picture quality.Details in dark scenes are clearly visible on the Sony, whereas they sometimes get lost on the C2.The ""it could be better"":*Brightness.This is really nit picking (no pun intended), but given that the A80K uses the same panel as the C2, yet is not quite as bright as somewhat of a mystery to me. To be honest, I can't see a definitive difference between the two, but it's worth mentioning.The Bad:*Only two HDMI 2.1 inputs, one of which is the same port used for a soundbar or receiver. To be fair, unless you're into next gen (PS5/Xbox X) gaming and have both consoles, this isn't going to be an issue, but a TV of this caliber should have four 2.1 inputs.*Potential for panel burn in.OLED technology has come a long way in the last decade, but the potential is still there for permanent burn in on individual pixels.If you watch a ton of TV (CNN with their bright white/red logo is a perfect example) that has a static logo, OLED probably shouldn't be on your want list, at least not yet.*Sustained bright picture will auto dim to protect the panel.While I've yet to experience this in anything other than intentionally trying to induce it, content with relatively bright areas over the majority of the panel, like ice hockey games,will activate auto dimming.*Dolby Vision.Please Sony, fix this.DV Dark is so out of whack that it's not even funny.While DV Bright can be made to look perfect as a DV Dark alternative, we deserve better.You did it on the A95K and LG's is great on their OLEDs, so we know it's possible.Remote: I get it, this isn't their flagship OLED, but it should come with the backlit remote.Movies and TV shows are this TV's strong points, and is particularly impressive with 4K High Dynamic Range/Dolby Vision content, both with hard copy and the built-in Google TV operating system.If sports (especially hockey) and/or the majority of your content has static logos, I'd probably stick with an LED backlit LCD TV.In closing, I did also consider the Sony A95K, the Samsung S95B and the LG C2 and G2.I passed on the Sony and Samsung because QD OLED is in its infancy, with a lot of long term questions about both burn in and longevity.The G2 lost out mostly because of the extra cost of a table top stand (wall mounting is not an option in my case).The A80K won over the C2 because of slightly better upscaling, the ability to pass DTS audio and the C2 having some problems with black crush.","Impressive TV, especially for movies",TRUE,"Title: Impressive TV, especially for movies Review: This XR65A80K I purchased was to replace an XR65X950H - the 950H is a very competent TV, and is still in use in a bedroom, but even as good as it is with its local dimming, the idea of zero blooming appealed to me.

I was like every scene featured a beautiful sunset.So, time to buy another TV! My natural inclination was to go with Samsung (I have other Samsung TVs that are going strong after years), but since this was the brand that failed—more precisely the technology used by Samsung—I started researching the technology I should be going with.After and lot a of reading and video watching I decided that OLED would be the best (really because its ability to turn off pixels and so create truly black blacks) and so looked for a good deal.It so happened that Sony was running a promotion on theBravia A80K, so that (together with a strong recommendation from my son who owns the same model but larger size) persuaded me to buy this model.Compared to my old TV, it's really night and day. I did have a 4K TV before, but this is better in so many ways. The colors are superbly rendered and the sound—which I feed into my eARC-enabled AVR—is really great. I can now get Dolby Atmos content rendered very nicely.The TV was really easy to set up but, and Sony warns you of this, you need two people to unpack and position the TV safely. The legs are easy to attach, but you need help to stabilize the TV while you do so. The menus are easy to navigate and setting up the screen and audio options was easy—I did have help from my son who, as I said, is familiar with the TV, but I could easily have done it myself.One of the things to get used to is having 2 ARC HDMI ports (there are 2 regular HDMIs too), so my Firestick is plugged into the back of the TV now, rather than the AVR. This is all possible because of eARC, so that is a big deal. Fortunately by AVR also has eARC, so connecting my system was easy: eARC from TV's HDMI 3 and Firestick into HDMI 4. I also plugged an ethernet cable into the ethernet port, which also made setting up super-easy. Having a hard-wired network connection (wifi is also available I think)made initial firmware updates really easy.I had read that there was an issue with the TV not being particularly bright. I have not found this to be the case at all, and our TV-watching room has a lot of ambient light.The remote control is very nicely designed and can you control connected devices as well as the TV. I use another kind of controller, but if I hadn't already bought that, I would certainly be using the Sony remote to control everything.In summary: Picture is superb, sound is amazing, set-up is easy.

The legs are easy to attach, but you need help to stabilize the TV while you do so.

This is all possible because of eARC, so that is a big deal. Fortunately by AVR also has eARC, so connecting my system was easy: eARC from TV's HDMI 3 and Firestick into HDMI 4. I also plugged an ethernet cable into the ethernet port, which also made setting up super-easy.

I use another kind of controller, but if I hadn't already bought that, I would certainly be using the Sony remote to control everything.In summary: Picture is superb, sound is amazing, set-up is easy.

If you are a gamer, buy the L.G.If you are into the hype of the Samsung being the best you can buy right now (it is fantastic) but are afraid of the firmware updates and bent screen problems, like me, buy the A80k or the A90k and live with the best picture, ease of use and a beautifully easy to set up interface for picture modes to combat the low bit and frame rates that occur if you watch mainly movies and streaming apps. I went from a mini led to this, my first oled, it was well worth the wait. 4k movies and blurays look fantastic, and if you plan to use this television as a computer screen, don't buy it. Static chyrons and info banners and logos can cause burn-in.Otherwise I would not worry about burn in. More to come.....","{

The picture quality is superb, and I haven't felt the need to do a lot of tweaking, much less calibration, to get it there (as I have in the past on other TV's). The overall look of the TV is very minimalistic, as the edge of the screen and the stand nearly disappear. Speaking of the stand, it's very stable while being low profile, and the multiple installation methods to modify the height, while I haven't needed them, are a useful feature that I'm sure many will appreciate. I can't speak to the internal speakers as I don't use them, but I can say the arc features work very well and very seamlessly. I can just turn on the Apple TV, and the TV and reciever both turn on and move to their correct inputs. Likewise, I can turn on the TV, and the same adjustments are made. I find I seldom need to adjust the TV or receiver. Just turn on the source and go. I've had issues with other TV's where arc either didn't do all I needed or at times, was fighting what I was trying to do. None of that with this TV. It does what you expect and need from arc pretty flawlessly.Now for all of the look and features, this TV is all about the picture, and it is awesome! I'm sure a tester could find some tiny flaw somewhere, but as a normal user with pretty big expectations, it delivers. I think you'd have to be looking for something to ding this TV on when it comes to picture quality, and even then, you'd probably need a pointer in the right direction to find it still. I'm sure there are likes and dislikes to be had on the smart tv features and the OS, but it's the picture that matters the most, and on that count, this Sony truly delivers! Oh, and set your Apple TV to use Dolby Vision and..... just wow!If you wonder about the true blacks of OLED, it's mostly what you don't notice that is the real story. None of the blooming or banding in dark scenes.

At least I'm still happy with the picture.Update 9-30-2022: TV has only required one restart to fix network issue. It's hard wired so I'm blaming the OS; everything else in the house was working. The TV interface continues to disappoint due to the number of clicks to do anything. I'm also getting tired of seeing all of recomended shows to watch served up from google. Plugging in a Roku is still an option.Tip 11-3-2022: Hold down the power button to reboot.","{
